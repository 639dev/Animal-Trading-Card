				<li><span class="label">Average Length</span>: 0.75 to 52 millimetres</li>
				<li><span class="label">Average Lifespan</span>: Depends on the caste</li>

			</ul>
			<p>Ants are common insects, but they have some unique capabilities. More than 10,000 known ant species occur around the world. They are especially prevalent in tropical forests, where they may be up to half of all the insects living in some locations. Ants inspire me enormously; they are so small but can do so much.</p>
